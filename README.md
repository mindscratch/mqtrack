# mqtrack

An application for consuming lines of text and storing them.

The initial idea is for message oriented applications (those that publish 
messages or consume messages), record a line with this application to
track which destinations they publish to or consume from.

The plan is store the information and produce a graphic that
shows how applications are connected.
